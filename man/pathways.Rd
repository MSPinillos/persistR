\title{Individual pathways of post-disturbance dynamics}
\usage{
pathways(abundance, sites, surveys, type = "mixed", onlyDraw = NULL,
  cluster = NULL, axes = c(1, 2), species = FALSE, zoom = FALSE,
  add.legend = FALSE, cluster.name = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{abundance}{A data frame containing species abundance of target communities for
three states relative to the occurrence of a disturbance (pre-disturbance, disturbed,
and final states). The three surveys of each site are in rows and species
are in columns.}

\item{sites}{A vector indicating the site of each community state.}

\item{surveys}{A vector indicating the survey of each community state.}

\item{type}{A character value indicating the type of pathways to be plotted.
\code{"mixed"} circular dots representing pre-disturbance states are linked by lines
to final states represented by triangles. \code{"points"} pre-disturbance,
disturbed and post-disturbance states are represented by circular, squared and triangular
points, respectively. \code{"arrows"} post-disturbance dynamics are represented by arrows.}

\item{onlyDraw}{A vector indicating a subset of sites to be plotted. Sites' identifier
must match to those in \code{sites}.}

\item{cluster}{A numeric or a vector of colors indicating the cluster to which each
community state belongs or the color used for each state. This option is only available
for \code{type = "mixed"} and \code{type = "points"}}

\item{axes}{The pair of the principal coordinates to be used in the plot.}

\item{species}{A logical flag to draw species arrows.}

\item{zoom}{A logical flag to zoom the plot to the community state coordinates.}

\item{add.legend}{A logical flag to add the plot legend.}

\item{cluster.name}{A character vector indicating the name of the cluster to which each
community state belongs. Values are specified in the legend if \code{add.legend = TRUE}.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters to \code{plot}}
}
\value{
Individual post-disturbance dynamics of a given set of communities are displayed
as pathways in an ordination space (PCA) by linking the pre-disturbance, disturbed, and
final states in chronological order.
}
\description{
The function \code{pathways} represents post-disturbance dynamics of a set
of disturbed communities as pathways displayed in an ordination space resulting from
applying principal component analyses (PCA) on the abundance matrix.
