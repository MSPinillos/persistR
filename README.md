# persistR - Resilience and post-disturbance dynamics of natural communities

## Introduction

`persistR` is a package designed to assess the response capacity of natural communities and gain insights into post-disturbance dynamics. `persistR` includes a set of functions to calculate different quantitative indices and apply descriptive analyses of post-disturbance dynamics:

* Calculate the response capacity of natural communities to disturbances based on species response traits (Sánchez-Pinillos et al. 2016)
* Calculate resistance and resilience indices based on dissimilarities between different temporal states defined in relation to the occurrence of a disturbance (Sánchez-Pinillos et al. unpublished)
* Assess post-disturbance dynamics of natural communities through dynamical pathways represented in a multidimensional space (Sánchez-Pinillos et al. unpublished).
